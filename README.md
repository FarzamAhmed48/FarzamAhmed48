# Hey, I'm Farzam Ahmed! 🚀 System Builder And Developer


Helping businesses scale with **AI-powered solutions** and **full-stack web development**. I'm a curious coder transitioning from building robust MERN stack apps to exploring the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on LLMs, chatbots, and automation.

## 🧠 About Me


I’m all about creating tech that makes an impact. With a strong foundation in **Full-Stack Development (MERN)**, I’ve built and deployed web and mobile apps from scratch, focusing on seamless user experiences and business-driven outcomes. Now, I’m diving headfirst into **AI**, exploring how Large Language Models, automation tools, and AI integrations can transform workflows and scale businesses.

Whether it’s crafting a responsive UI, optimizing a database, or building an AI-powered chatbot, I thrive on turning ideas into reality. Let’s build something that levels up your business!

- **AI & Automation**: Experimenting with LLMs, chatbots, and automation scripts to streamline processes and boost efficiency.
- **Business Growth**: Delivering custom web, app, and AI solutions to help startups and businesses scale.
- **DevOps**: Automating workflows with Docker, GitHub Actions, and PM2 for smooth, scalable deployments.
- **Open Source**: Built tools like `socket.io-rabbitmq`, a Node.js adapter for distributed real-time messaging.
